            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                <span class="tab">A good UX design is the heart of every successful product. To say that an application
                    has good UX</span> design, it must be easy to use, users must be able to find what they are looking for quickly and seamlessly. The design should look good, tidy, clean and modern. We can give “Instagram” as an example.
                It is really easy to use. There are only 3 sections – your news feed where you can see your friend’s posts, your personal page where your photos and information is stored, and the camera section which also has various features that are
                clearly expressed and every user, even the first-time user can understand what they are doing. “Snapchat is the second example. This is an app like “Instagram” in which you share photos and videos with your friends. The difference is that
                there is a timeout feature which you can set to your photo so your friend can see it only once for 10 seconds. If the second user tries to save your photo you receive a notification. Another good feature is called “Snap map”. This is a
                live map where you can find the location of your friends and it is good to make meeting. The simplest explanation for why the UX Design of these applications is good is that everything is tidy, the buttons have a clear function, and if
                you need something you can search for it with the search bar.
                <br>
                <span class="tab">The experience can be awful if the product is difficult to navigate, cluttered and
                    poor looking. This</span> can quickly replace it with a competing product that has a better UX design. For me it is difficult to give example about an app with really bad UX because I haven't found one yet. Let’s say
                the difference between mobile and desktop version of Facebook. The desktop version has features which in the mobile they are very hard to find or hidden. In the past mobile Facebook was even worse than now. Everything was mixed, hard to
                find, with poor layout, etc. As we can see today, developers are working hard to improve the look of the application and it is now much easier to use.
