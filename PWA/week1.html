            <h3 align="center">The use of AI in our daily life</h3>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">
                <span class="tab">Artificial intelligence, also called “AI”, is a technology that keeps on evolving
                    every day. It makes it easy for us to use services or devices such as our smartphones. </span> For example, if you are lazy and you are laying on the couch, you can say to your phone to play music and it will do it.
                You can also switch on the TV, adjust the temperature of the heaters, switch on the automatic vacuum cleaner and so on.
                <br>
                <span class="tab">Every day I use my Google Home voice assistant and I really like it because I can get
                    information for everything like weather forecast, appointments in my calendar, </span> setting an alarm and also I can switch on my TV. The only thing I don’t like about that service is that sometimes it cannot understand
                properly what you are saying and most of the times this problem is due to poor internet connection.
                <br>
                <span class="tab">Another example is the word auto correction, which is included in every smartphone and
                    computer programs like MS Office. It is very useful when you have to respond to a </span> message quickly and usually you are not looking for what you have written before you send the message and this AI removes the
                mistakes and can check the punctuation. But sometimes you use some words which the auto correction cannot identify their context and even if there is no mistake, they are replaced with others. This is so annoying and slows down your writing.
